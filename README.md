# 🌊 Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs)

**Explore the unseen world beneath the ocean with cutting-edge sensor technology.**  
This project focuses on developing and understanding Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs)—a powerful IoT-based solution for underwater monitoring and data collection in challenging marine environments.

## 📌 Project Overview

Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) are networks of smart, autonomous sensor nodes (also known as *motes*) designed to operate in harsh underwater environments. These motes use **acoustic communication** instead of radio signals, which are weak in water, allowing for long-range, reliable data transfer.

The main goals of UASNs include:

- Monitoring marine life
- Detecting natural events like tsunamis or underwater earthquakes
- Measuring physical, chemical, and biological changes in oceans, lakes, or rivers

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔊 **Acoustic Communication**: Transmits data using sound waves, effective even in deep and turbid waters.
- 🔋 **Energy Harvesting**: Nodes can gather energy from the environment to power themselves for long missions.
- 🧠 **Real-time Processing**: Embedded processors on each node allow immediate data analysis.
- 🌐 **Mesh Networking**: Nodes connect and work together, covering large areas efficiently.
- 🌡️ **Multi-Phenomena Sensing**: Measures temperature, salinity, pressure, movement, and more.

## 🧱 System Components

- **Sensor Nodes (Motes)**: Small, smart devices with sensors, acoustic modems, power systems, and processors.
- **Acoustic Modems**: For underwater data transmission.
- **Energy Modules**: Solar, wave, or thermal energy harvesting.
- **Central Hub (Surface Buoy/Gateway)**: Receives data from underwater nodes and relays it to land-based systems.
